üìÑ About The Project
This project aims to create an intelligent system that provides users with a preliminary risk assessment for certain diseases. By analyzing a combination of symptoms, demographic data, local environmental conditions, and weather patterns, the platform can identify potential health risks and suggest further action.

Core Objectives:

Data-Driven Predictions: Utilize machine learning models to predict disease probability.

Environmental Correlation: Integrate real-time weather and location data to enhance prediction accuracy.

User-Friendly Interface: Provide an intuitive web interface for users to input their data and receive clear, understandable results.

Data Visualization: Display trends and correlations on a map or through charts.

‚ú® Features
Symptom Checker: A dynamic form for users to input their symptoms.

Location & Weather Integration: Automatically fetches user location (with permission) and corresponding real-time weather data from an API.

Machine Learning Backend: A Python-based API that processes the data and returns a prediction.

Historical Data Analysis (Planned): Track predictions and environmental data over time to identify trends.

Informative Dashboard (Planned): Visualize risk levels on a map and show aggregated, anonymized data.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
This project will be built using a modern technology stack:

Frontend:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

A frontend framework like React or Vue.js for a reactive UI.

Mapping library like Leaflet.js or Mapbox for data visualization.

Backend:

Python 3.8+

Flask or FastAPI for creating the REST API.

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/PyTorch for building and serving the prediction models.

Database:

PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user data and model results.

APIs:

OpenWeatherMap API or similar for weather data.

Google Maps Geocoding API or similar for location data.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ and Pip

Node.js and npm

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/predictive-health-platform.git](https://github.com/your-username/predictive-health-platform.git)
cd predictive-health-platform

Backend Setup:

# Navigate to the backend directory (once created)
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Frontend Setup:

# Navigate to the frontend directory (once created)
cd ../frontend

# Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install

Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory.

Add your API keys and database credentials. See .env.example for a template.

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here

Running the Application
Start the Backend Server:

# From the /backend directory
python app.py

Start the Frontend Development Server:

# From the /frontend directory
npm start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
